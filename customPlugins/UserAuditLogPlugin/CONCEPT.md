# UserAuditLogPlugin — Concept & Design

> Status: **Ready for Implementation**
> Branch: `lime-survey-plugin`
> Scope: POC — all surveys, localhost only

---

## 1. Purpose

An eCRF audit log must capture a **full chronological record** of every interaction a user
makes with a survey — not just the final submitted values. This includes entering the survey,
navigating between pages, and every individual answer change (even if a value is overwritten
multiple times before submission).

This plugin replaces the HelloWorld console-only approach with **persistent server-side logging
into PostgreSQL**.

---

## 1a. Parallel Workflow — How This Sits Alongside LimeSurvey

**LimeSurvey's own persistence model:**
- Answers are only written to the LimeSurvey response table (`lime_survey_XXXXX`) when the
  user clicks **Next, Previous, or Submit**.
- Each click sends a full-page POST; LimeSurvey saves the current state of all answers on that
  page as a bulk snapshot.
- LimeSurvey has **no field-level change history** — it only ever knows the last saved value.

**Our audit log runs as a parallel, independent layer using AJAX:**

When a user changes a field, the browser JS immediately fires a silent background HTTP request
(AJAX) to our plugin endpoint — **no Next click required, no page reload, invisible to the user**.
The PHP endpoint receives it and writes a row to `lime_user_audit_log` right away.

```
User changes BPM: 72 → 75
  → JS fires AJAX in background immediately
  → audit row written: old_value=72, new_value=75

User changes BPM again: 75 → 80
  → JS fires AJAX in background immediately
  → audit row written: old_value=75, new_value=80

User clicks Next
  → LimeSurvey saves 80 to lime_survey_XXXXX  (only sees the final value)
  → our beforeSurveyPage hook fires
  → audit row written: event_type=page_load
```

LimeSurvey ends up knowing the answer was **80**.
Our audit log records the full history: **72 → 75 → 80**, with a timestamp on each change.

If a user changes an answer and closes the browser without clicking Next, LimeSurvey loses
those changes entirely — our audit table still has them.

**When exactly does an `answer_change` event fire?**

The JS listens for jQuery's `change` event (via `$(document).on("change", ...)`) rather than
the native DOM `addEventListener`. This is required because LimeSurvey's date picker and other
widgets fire jQuery-triggered change events that do not propagate to native DOM listeners.
The event fires at different moments depending on the input type:

| Input type | When the audit row is written |
|---|---|
| Radio button | As soon as a new option is selected |
| Checkbox | As soon as it is checked / unchecked |
| Dropdown / select | As soon as a new option is picked |
| Text / number field | When the user **leaves the field** (tabs out or clicks away) |
| Date picker | When a date is selected |

For text fields this means: if a user types `7`, corrects to `72`, then to `720`, then
backspaces back to `72` — only **one** audit row is written (when they leave the field),
with `new_value=72`. The intermediate keystrokes are not logged. This is intentional —
it gives one clean "committed value" entry per field interaction rather than one row per
keystroke, which keeps the audit log readable and meaningful for eCRF review.

> **Note (post-POC):** LimeSurvey supports many additional question types beyond the ones
> listed above — including arrays, ranking, slider, file upload, geolocation, equation,
> image select, and dual-scale arrays. Each has a different HTML structure and may not
> fire a standard `change` event in the same way. The POC covers the common types
> (radio, checkbox, select, text, date). A full production implementation must audit
> all LimeSurvey question types and ensure each is correctly captured by the JS listener.

---

## 2. What Gets Logged

Every row in the audit table represents one discrete event. The table is sorted by `created_at`.

| `event_type` | Triggered by | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `survey_open` | PHP: `beforeSurveyPage` on page 1 | User enters the survey for the first time |
| `page_load` | PHP: `beforeSurveyPage` on pages > 1 | User navigated to a new page (next/prev) |
| `answer_change` | JS → AJAX → PHP endpoint | User changed an answer within a page |
| `survey_submit` | PHP: `afterSurveyComplete` | User submitted the completed survey |

### Why AJAX for answer changes?

LimeSurvey pages are server-rendered PHP. Answer changes within a single page happen
entirely in the browser — they never reach the server until the user clicks "next".
To log each individual change immediately (before navigation), JavaScript must capture
the event and POST it to a small PHP endpoint exposed by this plugin.

---

## 3. OAuth Enforcement

**POC scope: enforce for ALL surveys.**

> **Note on testing:** Keycloak is not available in the local POC environment. OAuth
> enforcement will be verified using LimeSurvey's local admin login as a stand-in.
> The redirect logic is the same regardless of auth provider.

### Goal
A user who only has a survey link must be blocked from accessing the survey without
authenticating first. After login they should ideally return directly to the survey.

---

### Option A — POC Implementation

Redirect unauthenticated users to the OAuth login page. After login, AuthOAuth2 lands
them on the admin dashboard. They must navigate back to the survey URL themselves.

**Flow:**
```
User opens survey URL
        │
        ▼
beforeSurveyPage fires
        │
        ├── isGuest? ──NO──► proceed, log access
        │
        YES
        │
        └── Redirect to:
            /index.php/admin/authentication/sa/login/authMethod/AuthOAuth2

            [user logs in → lands on admin dashboard]
            [user must open survey URL again]
```

Simple to implement. No hooks beyond `beforeSurveyPage`. No Keycloak dependency for
testing. UX is acceptable if users are instructed to log in before opening a survey link.

---

### Option B — Post-POC: Return to Survey After Login

After login, the user is redirected automatically back to the survey URL they came from.
No manual navigation needed.

**Approach:** Subscribe to LimeSurvey's `newUserSession` hook, which fires after any
successful authentication (form login, OAuth, or any auth plugin) — no changes to
AuthOAuth2 required.

> **Tested & rejected (POC):** `newUserSession` fires on every request with an existing
> session, not only at login. Using it for redirect breaks the login flow entirely.
> The `beforeSurveyPage` fallback (Option A flow) is used instead.

**Flow:**
```
User opens survey URL (e.g. /index.php/12345?token=abc123)
        │
        ▼
beforeSurveyPage — isGuest?
        │
        YES
        │
        ├── Store URL in session:
        │   session['userauditlog_return_url'] = current URL
        │
        └── Redirect to OAuth login

        [user authenticates]
        │
        ▼
newUserSession hook fires in our plugin
        │
        ├── 'userauditlog_return_url' in session? ──NO──► do nothing
        │
        YES
        │
        ├── Read + unset the stored URL
        └── Redirect → user lands back on the survey
```

**Fallback** (if `newUserSession` does not fire as expected): recover the stored URL
on the next `beforeSurveyPage` call instead — the user is now authenticated, so we
redirect then and clear the session key.

> Per-survey toggle (using `newSurveySettings`) is a further post-POC step.

---

## 4. Database Schema

### Why a separate table (not combined with `lime_auditlog_log`)

The built-in `lime_auditlog_log` table is owned and written by LimeSurvey's own AuditLog
plugin and tracks admin interface actions only. Our table serves a different purpose and
audience entirely — eCRF participant interactions by authenticated clinical users.

Merging the two would require either squeezing our structured data into their untyped
`oldvalues`/`newvalues` text blobs (losing all typed columns), or adding our columns to
a table we don't own (breaks if the built-in plugin is disabled or updated).

Both tables coexist independently. They answer different questions:
- `lime_auditlog_log` → "who changed survey configuration in the admin panel?"
- `lime_user_audit_log` → "what did clinician X enter for patient Y in question BPM and when?"

### Design decisions (vs. built-in `lime_auditlog_log`)

| Built-in AuditLog | UserAuditLogPlugin |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| One row = one admin action | One row = one discrete event or answer change |
| `entity` + `action` as free text | Typed `event_type` column |
| `fields`/`oldvalues`/`newvalues` as CSV/blob | Flat columns: `old_value`, `new_value`, `question_id`, `question_code` |
| Admin interface only | Survey participant + OAuth user events |
| No session or page context | `page_number`, `group_id`, `session_id` |

### Table: `lime_user_audit_log`

```sql
CREATE TABLE lime_user_audit_log (
    -- Identity
    id                  BIGSERIAL       PRIMARY KEY,

    -- When (table sorted by this)
    created_at          TIMESTAMPTZ     NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),

    -- Which survey / participant
    survey_id           INTEGER         NOT NULL,
    participant_token   VARCHAR(255),       -- survey access token

    -- Who (authenticated via OAuth / Keycloak)
    oauth_user_id       VARCHAR(255),       -- Yii::app()->user->id
    oauth_username      VARCHAR(255),       -- Yii::app()->user->name

    -- What kind of event
    event_type          VARCHAR(50)     NOT NULL,
    -- Values: survey_open | page_load | answer_change | survey_submit

    -- Navigation context (set for all event types)
    page_number         INTEGER,            -- current page/step index
    group_id            INTEGER,            -- LimeSurvey question group ID

    -- Question context (set for answer_change only)
    question_id         INTEGER,            -- LimeSurvey internal numeric question ID
    question_code       VARCHAR(255),       -- researcher-defined question code (e.g. "BPM")
    sub_question_code   VARCHAR(50),        -- for matrix/array questions (row code)
    input_type          VARCHAR(50),        -- radio | checkbox | text | select | date | ...

    -- Change payload (set for answer_change; old_value NULL on first answer)
    old_value           TEXT,
    new_value           TEXT,

    -- Network / session context
    session_id          VARCHAR(255),       -- PHP session ID for correlation
    ip_address          VARCHAR(45)         -- supports IPv6
);

-- Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_ual_survey_id   ON lime_user_audit_log (survey_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_ual_created_at  ON lime_user_audit_log (created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_ual_oauth_user  ON lime_user_audit_log (oauth_user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_ual_token       ON lime_user_audit_log (participant_token);
CREATE INDEX idx_ual_event_type  ON lime_user_audit_log (event_type);
```

### Rationale for flat columns instead of JSONB

Each row is one atomic change to one question. Flat columns allow direct SQL queries
without unpacking JSON:

```sql
-- Full history for one participant, chronological
SELECT created_at, event_type, question_code, old_value, new_value
FROM lime_user_audit_log
WHERE participant_token = 'abc123'
ORDER BY created_at;

-- All changes to a specific question across all sessions
SELECT * FROM lime_user_audit_log
WHERE survey_id = 12345
  AND question_code = 'BPM'
ORDER BY created_at;
```

### `question_id` and `question_code` — POC scope

LimeSurvey has two question identifiers:
- `question_id` — internal numeric ID, parseable directly from the input name (`answer{SID}X{QID}X{SQID}`)
- `question_code` — set by the survey designer (e.g. `"BPM"`, `"VISIT_DATE"`), not in the DOM

**POC:** only `question_code` is logged. PHP injects a `{ questionId → questionCode }` map for
the current page; JS looks up the code via the numeric ID parsed from the input name and sends
it in the AJAX payload. The `question_id` column stays `NULL`.

> **Post-POC:** parse the numeric `question_id` directly from the input name and populate that
> column as well. Both columns then act as a fallback for each other.

### `old_value` and `new_value` policy

| Situation | `old_value` | `new_value` |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| First time answering a question | `null` | the entered value |
| Changing an existing answer | previous value | the new value |
| Clearing an answer | previous value | `null` |

Every `answer_change` event has both fields present (null = no value). This gives a full
diff history even if a question is changed 10 times in one session.

## 5. Plugin Architecture

### Files

```
customPlugins/UserAuditLogPlugin/
├── CONCEPT.md
├── config.xml
└── UserAuditLogPlugin.php
```

### PHP hooks

| Hook | Method | What it does |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `beforeSurveyPage` | `onBeforeSurveyPage()` | 1. Redirect guest to OAuth login. 2. Log `survey_open` or `page_load`. |
| `afterSurveyComplete` | `onAfterSurveyComplete()` | Log `survey_submit`. |
| `newUnsecuredDirectRequest` | `onNewUnsecuredDirectRequest()` | Expose AJAX endpoint for JS to POST `answer_change` events. |

### AJAX endpoint (for answer_change)

URL pattern:
```
GET/POST /index.php/plugins/unsecure/plugin/UserAuditLogPlugin/function/logAnswerChange
```

Payload (POST JSON body):
```json
{
  "survey_id":        12345,
  "group_id":         3,
  "page_number":      2,
  "question_id":      42,
  "question_code":    "BPM",
  "sub_question_code": null,
  "input_type":       "text",
  "old_value":        "72",
  "new_value":        "75"
}
```

The endpoint:
1. Validates the request originates from the same session (checks PHP session)
2. Reads `oauth_user_id`, `oauth_username`, `participant_token`, `session_id`, `ip_address`
   from the server side (never trusted from the client payload)
3. Writes one row to `lime_user_audit_log`
4. Returns **HTTP 200** on success, non-200 on failure — no JSON body required.
   The JS checks `response.ok` and silently ignores errors (fire-and-forget).

### JavaScript (injected via `beforeSurveyPage`)

The JS is the same event-driven approach as HelloWorld, but instead of `console.log` it
fires `fetch()` to the AJAX endpoint above.

Events captured:
- `change` on any `input`, `select`, `textarea` → `answer_change`
- Page submit button click → nothing extra needed (server-side `beforeSurveyPage` handles it)

**Question code lookup:** PHP injects a `questionCodeMap` JSON object (`{ "42": "BPM", ... }`)
for all questions on the current page. JS parses the numeric question ID from the input name
and looks up the corresponding `question_code` from the map.

> **LimeSurvey 6 input name format:** The `answer` prefix was dropped in LimeSurvey 6.
> Input names follow the pattern `{SID}X{GID}X{QID}` (e.g. `376198X6X18`), where the
> third segment is the question ID and the second segment is the group ID.
> The regex `^(\d+)X(\d+)X(\d+)(\w*)$` is used instead of the old `answer\d+X...` pattern.
Only `question_code` is sent in the AJAX payload (POC scope — `question_id` column stays NULL).

Old value tracking: the JS records the value of each field at page load, then sends the
snapshot as `old_value` when a `change` event fires.

---

## 6. Table Creation

The plugin creates its own table on first activation. No manual migration needed.

```php
private function ensureTable(): void
{
    $db    = Yii::app()->db;
    $table = $db->tablePrefix . 'user_audit_log';

    if ($db->schema->getTable($table) !== null) {
        return;
    }

    $db->createCommand()->createTable($table, [
        'id'                 => 'BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY',
        'created_at'         => 'TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()',
        'survey_id'          => 'INTEGER NOT NULL',
        'participant_token'  => 'VARCHAR(255)',
        'oauth_user_id'      => 'VARCHAR(255)',
        'oauth_username'     => 'VARCHAR(255)',
        'event_type'         => 'VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL',
        'page_number'        => 'INTEGER',
        'group_id'           => 'INTEGER',
        'question_id'        => 'INTEGER',
        'question_code'      => 'VARCHAR(255)',
        'sub_question_code'  => 'VARCHAR(50)',
        'input_type'         => 'VARCHAR(50)',
        'old_value'          => 'TEXT',
        'new_value'          => 'TEXT',
        'session_id'         => 'VARCHAR(255)',
        'ip_address'         => 'VARCHAR(45)',
    ]);

    // Create indexes
    foreach (['survey_id','created_at','oauth_user_id','participant_token','event_type'] as $col) {
        $db->createCommand()->createIndex("idx_ual_{$col}", $table, $col);
    }
}
```

## 7. Dockerfile Change

```dockerfile
COPY --chown=33:33 customPlugins/UserAuditLogPlugin /var/www/html/plugins/UserAuditLogPlugin
```

---

## 8. Implementation Plan

### Working agreement

- **One step per session round.** A step is implemented, then reviewed by the developer before the next step begins.
- **Docker-testable after every step except Step 1.** The Dockerfile entry is added in Step 2 so the plugin is mounted into the container from that point on. Every subsequent step ends with a `docker compose up --build` and a manual test.
- **Status is updated in this table** after each completed step so progress is clear when resuming across sessions.
- **`newUnsecuredDirectRequest` routing note:** The `function` segment in the AJAX URL (`/function/logAnswerChange`) is just a string parameter we read with `$this->event->get('function')` inside the single `newUnsecuredDirectRequest` handler. It does **not** need to match a PHP method name — the name is freely chosen.

| Step | Title | Short Description | Status |
|------|-------|-------------------|--------|
| 1 | `config.xml` | Create `config.xml` for `UserAuditLogPlugin` (based on HelloWorld). No Docker test needed for this step. | **done** |
| 2 | Skeleton `UserAuditLogPlugin.php` + Dockerfile | Create the PHP class with `init()` subscribing all three hooks (`beforeSurveyPage`, `afterSurveyComplete`, `newUnsecuredDirectRequest`). Method bodies empty/stubbed. **Also add the Dockerfile COPY line in this step** so the plugin is in the container from here on. Rebuild, activate plugin in LimeSurvey admin, verify it loads without errors. | **done** |
| 3 | `ensureTable()` + `writeLog()` | Add the private `ensureTable()` method (creates `lime_user_audit_log` + indexes on first run) and the private `writeLog(array $data)` helper that inserts one row. Call `ensureTable()` from `init()`. Rebuild, verify the table appears in the DB after container start. | **done** |
| 4 | `onBeforeSurveyPage()` — OAuth redirect + return to survey | Guest check: store current URL in session, redirect to OAuth login. After login, `beforeSurveyPage` fallback detects stored URL and redirects back. Note: `newUserSession` hook was attempted but breaks every login (fires on all requests, not just login) — removed. Rebuild, test: open survey logged out → login → open any survey page → should land back on original survey. | **done** |
| 5 | `onBeforeSurveyPage()` — `survey_open` / `page_load` logging | After the guest check, log `survey_open` (page 1) or `page_load` (pages > 1) via `writeLog()`. Rebuild, navigate through a survey and verify rows appear in `lime_user_audit_log`. | **done** |
| 6 | `onAfterSurveyComplete()` — `survey_submit` logging | Log a `survey_submit` row when the survey is completed. Rebuild, submit a survey and confirm the row. | **done — untested** ⚠️ Survey submit returns HTTP 401 in the current environment (pre-existing issue, unrelated to this plugin — confirmed by deactivating the plugin, 401 persists). Needs to be verified once the survey end-URL / Spring Boot auth issue is resolved. Forwarded to the original implementor. |
| 7 | `onNewUnsecuredDirectRequest()` — AJAX endpoint | Expose the `logAnswerChange` function (read via `$this->event->get('function')`): validate session, read server-side fields, insert one `answer_change` row, return HTTP 200. Rebuild, test with `curl` or Postman. | **done** |
| 8 | JavaScript — `questionCodeMap` injection | In `onBeforeSurveyPage()`, query `Question::model()` for the current page's questions, build the `{ questionId → questionCode }` map, inject as JS variable via `clientScript->registerScript()`. Rebuild, verify the map is present in the browser console. | **done** |
| 9 | JavaScript — `answer_change` event listeners | Add the full JS block: old-value snapshot at page load, `change` listener that looks up `question_code` from the map and fires `fetch()` to the AJAX endpoint. Rebuild, change answers and watch rows appear in the DB. | **done** |

---

## 9. Verification Queries

DB container: `more-studymanager-backend-lime-db-1` — credentials: `-U limesurvey -d limesurvey`

```bash
# Check table structure
docker exec -it more-studymanager-backend-lime-db-1 psql -U limesurvey -d limesurvey -c "\d lime_user_audit_log"

# Watch the audit log live while filling in a survey
docker exec -it more-studymanager-backend-lime-db-1 psql -U limesurvey -d limesurvey -c "SELECT created_at, event_type, oauth_username, participant_token, question_code, old_value, new_value FROM lime_user_audit_log ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 30;"

# Quick check — all rows
docker exec -it more-studymanager-backend-lime-db-1 psql -U limesurvey -d limesurvey -c "SELECT id, created_at, event_type, session_id, ip_address FROM lime_user_audit_log ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;"

# Clear table (during testing)
docker exec -it more-studymanager-backend-lime-db-1 psql -U limesurvey -d limesurvey -c "TRUNCATE lime_user_audit_log;"
```

---

## 10. Open Questions (for after POC)

| # | Question |
|---|---------|
| 1 | `newUserSession` hook behaviour needs to be verified against a live container — fallback is to recover the stored return URL on the next `beforeSurveyPage` call. |
| 2 | For "update response" surveys (participant returns to amend answers), the JS old-value snapshot should be seeded from the DB — is this needed for the POC? |
| 3 | GDPR: should `participant_email` / `participant_name` be stored, or just the token? Currently only the token is stored. |
| 4 | Per-survey OAuth toggle (via `newSurveySettings`) as a follow-up to the POC. |

### Decoupled Authentication and Logging 

The original idea was to enforce a oauth login for the user before answering the survey. However, we found out that the Auditlog can be allowed to log even if no oauth user is present.

#### Authentication & OAuth Integration
   
New Decoupled Workflow: The plugin no longer enforces a redirect to the OAuth login page. This allows the UserAuditLogPlugin to operate independently of the AuthOAuth2 plugin.

 - Independent Activation: Both plugins can be activated or deactivated separately.
 - Passive Logging: The audit log will always record survey interactions (page loads, answer changes, etc.) regardless of the user's login status.
 - Graceful Identity Capture:
    - If a user is logged in via OAuth (or any other method), their oauth_user_id and oauth_username are captured from Yii::app()->user.
    - If the user is a guest, these fields are simply recorded as null in the database.
 - Simplified Logic: By removing the "Auth Guard" redirect, we eliminate the need for complex session management (like userauditlog_return_url) and ensure the user experience remains uninterrupted by forced login screens unless required by LimeSurvey's own survey settings.

 ##### Note on Plugin Independence (April 2026)
As of the latest implementation, the UserAuditLogPlugin follows a "Log what is available" philosophy. It does not act as a gatekeeper for survey access. If your project requires mandatory OAuth authentication, this should be configured via LimeSurvey's internal survey permissions or the AuthOAuth2 plugin settings. The audit log will faithfully record the identity of whoever is interacting with the survey, even if they are an anonymous guest.
